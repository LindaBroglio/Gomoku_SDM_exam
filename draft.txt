To do:

V - allow user to input moves from terminal
V - allow user to quit
- determine winner
  - define neighbouring nodes
V - assess illegal moves


Exceptions:
V - illegal board size
- illegal move
   V - out of board
   V - already occupied node

Test:
- does the game end when i type quit --> does white win if black resigns
- does it ask again when white writes a typo --> is it still white turn
- does the right team win --> does black win at turn 5
- does it end in draw when board is full and there is no winner

Refactoring ideas:
- create a class containing static methods and members for board specification
