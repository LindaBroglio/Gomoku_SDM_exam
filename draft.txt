To do:
V - allow user to input moves from terminal
V - allow user to quit
V - determine winner
  V - define neighbouring nodes
V - assess illegal moves
V - add numbers on board
V - get boardSize() from input

Exceptions:
V - illegal board size
V - illegal move
   V - out of board
   V - already occupied node
V - how many to win < board size!

Test:
- Board test
V - Color test
V- Game test
V - Node test
V - does the game end when i type quit --> does white win if black resigns
V - does it ask again when white writes a typo --> is it still white turn
V - does the right team win --> does black win at turn 5
V - does it end in draw when board is full and there is no winner
V - tests that use System.setIn(in)

Refactoring ideas:
V - create a class containing static methods and members for board specification

Add:
- variant where +5 stones does not count

Written on sunday 14:
V - don't do System.exit(0) when typo in "GUI or CLI"
V - fix board size error (it's 1 row and 1 col smaller) --> outofboard exception missing on right and bottom
V - switch from squares to circles
V - fix game (CLI) tests
V - exception errors to be shown on the board window and not a new one
