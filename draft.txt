To do:
V - allow user to input moves from terminal
V - allow user to quit
- determine winner
  - define neighbouring nodes
V - assess illegal moves
- add numbers on board
- get boardSize() from input

Exceptions:
V - illegal board size
V - illegal move
   V - out of board
   V - already occupied node
- how many to win < board size!

Test:
- Board test
V - Color test
- Game test
V - Node test
- does the game end when i type quit --> does white win if black resigns
- does it ask again when white writes a typo --> is it still white turn
- does the right team win --> does black win at turn 5
- does it end in draw when board is full and there is no winner
- tests that use System.setIn(in)

Refactoring ideas:
V - create a class containing static methods and members for board specification

Add:
- variant where +5 stones does not count

Done:
- reorganizing test classes: created InputTest, MoveTest; all methods are tested

To do:
- Create a GameTest class and maybe a MainTestClass
